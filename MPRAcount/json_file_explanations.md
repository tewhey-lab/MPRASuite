Here is the list of parameters provided in the JSON file to facilitate easy implementation by users according to the library design requirements:

  {
  "MPRAcount.parsed": "File", [Path to the parsed file generated by the MPRAmatch pipeline]
  "MPRAcount.acc_id": "File", [Path to the file with format explained in the README section-4a]
  "MPRAcount.working_directory": "/path/to/MPRASuite/MPRAcount/scripts", [[Path to the MPRAcount scripts folder]]
  "MPRAcount.out_directory":"String", [Path to the desired output directory for MPRAcount]
  "MPRAcount.id_out": "String", [Project ID or library name]
  "MPRAcount.replicate_fastq": "Array[File]", [List of fastq files for each replicate for all cell types being analyzed]
  "MPRAcount.replicate_id": "Array[String]" [List of IDs provided for each cell replicate]
}


The JSON file used in the pipeline currently applies default values for all the listed parameters. If your library preparation involves different settings, please update the parameters accordingly and manually provide the JSON file in the config file.
