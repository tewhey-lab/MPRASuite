# _MPRASuite_

MPRAsuite is a set of three pipelines developed to aid in the analysis of Massively Parallel Reporter Assays (MPRAs). Each pipeline is used alongside (i) building the MPRA library, (ii) transfecting the library into different cell types, (iii) analyzing the library to identify statistically significant variants or regions in the genome (depending on the purpose of the library). 
In order to develop the MPRAsuite we took the framework used by Tewhey et al (2016) and generalized the steps to allow the data to be run on any given library with minimal inputs needed. 

### Please see the below links associated to each of the three pipelines for detail documentation:
